** Description: This file is one of 11 files that together form a program
**              with the capability of running a simulation of the game 
**              zoo tycoon. The game will allow the user to purchase 
**              animals, and will keep track of the user's bank balance, 
**              adding to it and subtracting to it accordingly. A random   
**              event will occur each turn (day) of the game.
